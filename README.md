# Test FastAPI
It's exactly as it sounds. I'm testing FastAPI (learning about it)

Run like:
```
uvicorn ex1:app --reload
```
Which mens "run the app named `app` in ex1.py and automatically reload server when `ex1.py` is changed"

## Examples
1. **Ex1**: Simple program structure (endpoints with and without variables)
2. TODO
